My Emacs Config
---

Emacs config for Go and JavaScript dev. Relatively Spacemacs-inspired, where pressing tab does pretty much everything you'd expect.

Usage
---

You should be able to `git clone` this into your `~/.emacs.d`, start Emacs, and have it install any missing packages.

The only relevant commands:

- `C-x C-f` - Helm find file. Push `<tab>` to advance to the next entry.
- `C-x C-t` - Toggle NeoTree. Push `<tab>` to open the file.
- Autocomplete starts after one letter. Push `<tab>` to go the next suggested completion.

I also use **evil-mode**. You'd better use it too!
